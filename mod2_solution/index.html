		<div id="es">Egg Sandwich</div>
		<p>You can expect a stellar sandwich shop like Cutty's to make a perfect egg sandwich. Rich brioche gets tender scrambled eggs, sharp cheddar, and your choice of sauce (truffle ketchup, spicy mayo, or red-eye mayo). You could stop there and have a perfect morning, but then you'd be missing toppings like beautifully crisp bacon or tender braised greens like Swiss chard. Or on this sandwich: both. They're worth the extra cost.</p>

		<div id="cr">Clam Roll</div>
		<p>Somewhere inside the clam roll lurks a great sandwich. Done right, it's a veritable horn-of-plenty of crunchy, chewy, perfectly oily, deep-fried shellfish piled high on a simple bun. But the amazing roadside seafood shack is one of America's great fallacies, where they more often than not take the local bounty (or worse, tins of discounted clam bellies), over-dredge it in an uninspired batter, and fry it in stale oil.</p>
